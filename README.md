# rock-paper-scissors
This is my version of the game as well as my firstJavascript Project.

## After Finishing the console version. 
I learned to use functions and also how to think of function scopes.
Conditional Statements gave me a bit of a headache.
Still have a lot more to learn. 
## Adding a UI
I've learned some DOM manipulation techniques!
It went smoothly except for the issue i encountered about where to call the game function.
Ill come back and add a new game button.
A few hours later: I added the new game button.
